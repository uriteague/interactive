<p>The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel<br>
And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides<br>
And a dark wind blows<br>
<br>
The government is corrupt<br>
And we're on so many drugs<br>
With the radio on and the curtains drawn<br>
<br>
We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine<br>
And the machine is bleeding to death<br>
<br>
The sun has fallen down<br>
And the billboards are all leering<br>
And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles<br>
<br>
It went like this:<br>
<br>
The buildings toppled in on themselves<br>
Mothers clutching babies<br>
Picked through the rubble<br>
And pulled out their hair<br>
<br>
The skyline was beautiful on fire<br>
All twisted metal stretching upwards<br>
Everything washed in a thin orange haze<br>
<br>
I said, "Kiss me, you're beautiful<br>
These are truly the last days"<br>
<br>
You grabbed my hand<br>
And we fell into it<br>
Like a daydream<br>
Or a fever<br>
<br>
We woke up one morning and fell a little further down<br>
For sure as the valley of death<br>
I open up my wallet<br>
And it's full of blood<br>
